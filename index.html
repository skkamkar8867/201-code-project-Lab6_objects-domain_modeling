    <h2>WHAT OUR CLIENTS ARE SAYING</h2>
    <p>This is as close to a patisserie as you will get!  The sandwiches are EXACTLY the same as I get from any street cart in Paris.  The bread is top notch and the butter is very apparent in the pastries.  If they run out of your favorites then, boo hoo, get there earlier! The addition of a few little cubes of candied fruit to my chicken sandwich made for a novel addition.
      The attachment of the wine bar is genius and a really fabulous selection of quality wines, especially Bordeaux, at very reasonable prices. They buy directly from the vintner without a middleman markup.  The wine  stewards are knowledgeable and encourage you to try different wines.  The charcouterie plate is exactly what is served in several wine bars I visited in Paris recently.
      This is what Bellevue is missing--a quiet intimate place for coffee & a treat, then a light lunch, and un ver du vin after work!!!
      Bravo!!</p>
